# Portofolio-
Hello!
My name is Thomas andriansyah
I'm here following the PSG work program
I also want to feel how it feels to make a robot
from arduino

I was born in Tangerang 
My age is 17 years. I was born on March 8, 2005

I like the art of music, my hobby is playing music
ranging from angklung, guitar, and pianika

Hope from the coach, I really want to be able to understand about Arduino,
hopefully the coach can train me here.

Thank you for your attention.
